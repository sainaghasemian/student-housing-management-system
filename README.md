# Student Housing Management System
Our team designed and implemented a website for a university housing system. This is a full-stack web application for managing university housing assignments, built with PHP and MySQL.

To run the website and database you must first install XAMPP 8.1.12-0. Within XAMPP you must have the following servers running: MySQL Database, ProFTPD, and Apache Web Server. 
Then you must import a zip file called CPSC471-Database-Project containing all the .php, .sql and .png/jpg files into your XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs folder.

You must also initialise the database in phpmyadmin. To do this you must type http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ into your web browser and import our UniversityHousing.sql file.
